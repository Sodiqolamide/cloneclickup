                            organization.
                            Every team member is trained and kept up to date on the latest security protocols. We
                            regularly undergo testing, training, and auditing of our practices and policies.</p>

                    <p>This policy defines behavioral, process, technical, and governance controls pertaining to
                        security at ClickUp that all personnel are required to implement in order to ensure the
                        confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the ClickUp service and data (“Policy”). All
                        personnel must review and be familiar with the rules and actions set forth below.</p>
                    <p>This Policy defines security requirements for:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>To allow our sites to function correctly.</li>

                            our services.</li>
                        <li>To enhance your experience on our sites and provide functionality that means for example you
                            don’t have to re-enter your details each time you engage with our sites or to record what
                            purchases you’ve made on our sites.

                    </ol>
                    <p>In the event of a conflict, the more restrictive measures apply.</p>
                    <h4 class="uul">1.1. Governance and Evolution</h4>
                    <p>This Policy was created in close collaboration with and approved by ClickUp executives. At least
                        annually, it is reviewed and modified as needed to ensure clarity, sufficiency of scope, concern
                        for customer and personnel interests, and general responsiveness to the evolving security
                        landscape and industry best practices.</p>
                    <h4 class="uul">1.2. Security Team</h4>
                    <p>The ClickUp security team oversees the implementation of this Policy, including</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>procurement, provisioning, maintenance, retirement, and reclamation of corporate computing
                            resources,
                        </li>
                        <li>all aspects of service development and operation related to security, privacy, access,
                            reliability, and survivability,</li>
                        <li>ongoing risk assessment, vulnerability management, incident response, and</li>
                        <li>ecurity-related human resources controls and personnel training.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4 class="uul">1.3. Risk Management Framework</h4>
                    <p>The security team maintains a Risk Management Framework derived from NIST SP 800-39 - “Managing
                        Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and System View” and NIST SP 800-30 - “Guide
                        for Conducting Risk Assessments”. Risk assessment exercises inform prioritization for ongoing
                        improvements to ClickUp’s security posture, which may include changes to this Policy itself.</p>
                    <p>Our Risk Management Framework incorporates the following:

                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Identification of relevant, potential threats.</li>
                        <li>A scheme for assessing the strength of implemented controls.</li>
                        <li>A scheme for assessing current risks and evaluating their severity.</li>
                        <li>A scheme for responding to risks.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h1>2. Personnel and Office Environment</h1>
                    <p>What are ClickUp’s expectations of its personnel and the workplace regarding systems and data?

                    </p>
                    <p>ClickUp is committed to protecting its customers, personnel, partners, and the company from
                        illegal or damaging actions by individuals, either knowingly or unknowingly in the context of
                        its established employment culture of openness, trust, maturity, and integrity.

                        This section outlines expected personnel behaviors affecting security and the acceptable use of
                        computer systems at ClickUp. These rules are in place to protect our personnel and ClickUp
                        itself, in that inappropriate use may expose customers and partners to risks including malware,
                        viruses, compromise of networked systems and services, and legal issues.</p>
                    <h4 class="uul">2.1. Work Behaviors</h4>
                    <p>The first line of defense in data security is the informed behavior of personnel, who play a
                        significant role in ensuring the security of all data, regardless of format. Such behaviors
                        include those listed in this section as well as any additional requirements specified in the
                        employee handbook, specific security processes, and other applicable codes of conduct.

                    </p>
                    <h5>Training</h5>
                    <p>All employees and contractors must complete the ClickUp security awareness and data handling
                        training programs at least annually.</p>
                    <h5>Unrecognized Persons and Visitors</h5>
                    <p>It is the responsibility of all personnel to take positive action to maintain physical security.
                        Challenge any unrecognized person present in a restricted office location. Any challenged person
                        who does not respond appropriately should be immediately reported to supervisory staff and the
                        security team. All visitors to ClickUp offices must be registered as such or accompanied by a
                        ClickUp employee.</p>
                    <h5>Clean Desk</h5>
                    <p>Personnel should maintain workspaces clear of sensitive or confidential material and take care to
                        clear workspaces of such material at the end of each workday.

                    </p>
                    <h5>Unattended Devices</h5>
                    <p>Unattended devices must be locked. All devices will have an automatic screen lock function set to
                        automatically activate upon no more than fifteen minutes of inactivity.</p>
                    <h5>Use of Corporate Assets</h5>
                    <p>Systems are to be used for business purposes in serving the interests of the company, and of our
                        clients and partners in the course of normal business operations. Personnel are responsible for
                        exercising good judgment regarding the reasonableness of personal use of systems. Only
                        ClickUp-managed hardware and software is permitted to be connected to or installed on corporate
                        equipment or networks and used to access ClickUp data. ClickUp-managed hardware and software
                        includes those either owned by ClickUp or owned by ClickUp personnel but enrolled in a ClickUp
                        device management system. Only software that has been approved for corporate use by ClickUp may
                        be installed on corporate equipment. All personnel must read and understand the list of
                        prohibited activities outlined in this Policy. Modifications or configuration changes are not
                        permitted without explicit written consent by the ClickUp security team.

                    </p>
                    <h5>Removable Storage, No Backups, Use of Cloud Storage</h5>
                    <p>Use of removable media such as USB drives is prohibited. Personnel may not configure work devices
                        to make backups or copies of data outside corporate policies. Instead, personnel are expected to
                        operate primarily “in the cloud” and treat local storage on computing devices as ephemeral.
                        ClickUp data must be saved to company-approved secure cloud storage (e.g. Google Docs) to ensure
                        that even in the event of a corporate device being lost, stolen, or damaged, such artifacts will
                        be immediately recoverable on a replacement device.</p>
                    <h5>Prohibited Activities</h5>
                    <p>The following activities are prohibited. Under certain conditions and with the explicit written
                        consent of the security team, personnel may be exempted from certain of these restrictions
                        during the course of their legitimate job responsibilities (e.g. planned penetration testing,
                        systems administration staff may have a need to disable the network access of a host if that
                        host is disrupting production services).

                    </p>
                    <p>The list below is by no means exhaustive, but attempts to provide a framework for activities
                        which fall into the category of unacceptable use.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Under no circumstances are personnel of ClickUp authorized to engage in any activity that is
                            illegal under local, state, federal or international law while utilizing ClickUp-owned
                            resources.</li>
                        <li>iolations of the rights of any person or company protected by copyright, trade secret,
                            patent or other intellectual property, or similar laws or regulations including, but not
                            limited to, the installation or distribution of "pirated" or other software products that
                            are not appropriately licensed for use by ClickUp.
                        </li>
                        <li>Violating or attempting to violate the terms of use or license agreement of any software
                            product used by ClickUp is strictly prohibited.</li>
                        <li>Unauthorized copying of copyrighted material including, but not limited to, digitization and
                            distribution of photographs from magazines, books or other copyrighted sources, copyrighted
                            music, and the installation of any copyrighted software for which ClickUp or the end user
                            does not have an active license is strictly prohibited.</li>
                        <li>Exporting software, technical information, encryption software or technology may result in a
                            violation of international or regional export control laws. The appropriate management
                            should be consulted prior to export of any material that is in question.</li>
                        <li>Revealing your account password to others or allowing use of your account by others. This
                            includes colleagues, as well as family and other household members when work is being done
                            at home.</li>
                        <li>Making fraudulent offers of products, items, or services originating from any ClickUp
                            account.</li>
                        <li>Making statements about warranty, expressly or implied, unless it is a part of normal job
                            duties and then only to the extent the warranties are consistent with ClickUp’s authorized
                            warranties.</li>
                        <li>Introduction of malicious programs into the network or server (e.g., viruses, worms, Trojan
                            horses, e-mail bombs, etc.).</li>
                        <li>Effecting security breaches or disruptions of network communication. Security breaches
                            include, but are not limited to, accessing data of which the employee is not an intended
                            recipient or logging into a server or account that the employee is not expressly authorized
                            to access. For purposes of this section, "disruption" includes, but is not limited to,
                            network sniffing, ping floods, packet spoofing, denial of service, and forged routing
                            information for malicious or unlawful purposes.</li>
                        <li>Except by or under the direct supervision of the security team, port scanning or security
                            scanning, or other such software designed to exploit or find computer, software, or network
                            vulnerabilities.</li>
                        <li>Executing any form of network monitoring which will intercept data not intended for the
                            employee’s host, unless this activity is a part of the employee’s normal job/duty.</li>
                        <li>Circumventing user authentication or security of any host, network or account or attempting
                            to break into an information resource or to bypass a security feature. This includes running
                            password-cracking programs or sniffer programs, and attempting to circumvent file or other

                    <h1>3. Personnel Identity and Access Management</h1>
                    <p class="itali">How does ClickUp define, control, and maintain user identity and permissions for
                        personnel?</p>
                    <h4 class="uul">3.1. User Accounts and Authentication</h4>
                    <p>Each individual having access to any ClickUp-controlled system does so via a G Suite user account
                        denoting their system identity. Such user accounts are required to have a unique username, a
                        unique strong password of at least 8 characters, and a two-factor authentication (2FA)
                        mechanism.

                    </p>
                    <h5>Logging into ClickUp Systems</h5>
                    <p>Logins by personnel may originate only from ClickUp-managed devices. Authentication is performed
                        by Google’s account management system, details of which can be found at
                        https://gsuite.google.com/security. ClickUp leverages G Suite’s facilities of detecting
                        malicious authentication attempts. Repeated failed attempts to authenticate may result in the
                        offending user account being locked or revoked.

                    </p>
                    <h5>Logging into Third Party Systems</h5>
                    <p>Whenever available, third-party systems must be configured to delegate authentication to
                        ClickUp’s G Suite account authentication system (described above) thereby consolidating
                        authentication controls into a single user account system that is centrally managed by the
                        security team.</p>
                    <p>When authentication to G Suite is not available, unique strong passwords must be created and
                        stored in the ClickUp approved password management system. Passwords must be paired with
                        two-factor/MFA authentication.

                    </p>
                    <h5>Revocation and Auditing of User Accounts</h5>
                    <p>User accounts are revoked (that is, disabled but not deleted) immediately upon personnel
                        separation. As a further
                        precaution, all user accounts are audited at least quarterly, and any inactive user accounts are
                        revoked.</p>
                    <h4 class="uul">3.2. Access Management
                    </h4>
                    <p>ClickUp adheres to the principle of least privilege, and every action attempted by a user account
                        is subject to access
                        control checks.</p>
                    <h5>Role-based Access Control</h5>
                    <p>ClickUp employs a role-based access control (RBAC) model utilizing Google-supplied facilities
                        such as organizational
                        units, user accounts, user groups, and sharing controls.</p>
                    <h5>Web Browsers and Extensions</h5>
                    <p>ClickUp may require use of a specified web browser(s) for normal business use and for access to
                        corporate data such as
                        email. For certain specified roles such as software development and web design, job activities
                        beyond those mentioned
                        above necessitate the use of a variety of browsers, and these roles may do so as needed for
                        those activities.</p>
                    <p>Any browser that is allowed to access corporate data such as email is subject to a
                        whitelist-based restriction on which
                        browser extensions can be installed.</p>
                    <h5>Administrative Access</h5>
                    <p>Access to administrative operations is strictly limited to security team members and further
                        restricted still as a
                        function of tenure and the principle of least privilege.</p>
                    <h5>Regular Review</h5>
                    <p>Access control policies are reviewed regularly with the goal of reducing or refining access
                        whenever possible. Changes
                        in job function by personnel trigger an access review as well.</p>
                    <h5>3.3. Termination</h5>
                    <p>Upon termination of personnel, whether voluntary or involuntary, the security team will follow
                        ClickUp’s personnel exit
                        procedure, which includes revocation of the associated user account and reclamation of
                        company-owned devices, office
                        keys or access cards, and all other corporate equipment and property prior to the final day of
                        employment.

                    <p>Sensitive data which must be decrypted (e.g. tokens) must use an approved encryption provider for
                        HSM functions, such as
                        KMS.

                    </p>
                    <p>On expiration of services, customers may instruct ClickUp to delete all customer data from

                    </h4>
                    <p>ClickUp uses Amazon Web Services for all infrastructure. AWS provides the following guidance
                        regarding their data
                        lifecycle policies:</p>
                    <p class="itali">Media storage devices used to store customer data are classified by AWS as Critical
                        and treated accordingly, as high
                        impact, throughout their life-cycles. AWS has exacting standards on how to install, service, and
                        eventually destroy the
                        devices when they are no longer useful. When a storage device has reached the end of its useful
                        life, AWS decommissions
                        media using techniques detailed in NIST 800-88. Media that stored customer data is not removed
                        from AWS control until it
                        has been securely decommissioned.</p>

                        <li>Annual penetration testing with an independent provider.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The ClickUp security team shall evaluate the severity of every detected vulnerability in terms of
                        the likelihood and
                        potential impact of an exploit, and shall develop mitigation strategies and schedules

                    </ol>
                    <p>The ClickUp security team shall make a determination of whether every indicator is
                        representative of an actual security
                        incident. The severity, scope, and root cause of every incident shall be evaluated, and
                        every incident shall be resolved
                        in a manner and timeframe commensurate with the severity and scope.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the event that a data breach affecting a customer has been detected, ClickUp will maintain
                        communication with the
